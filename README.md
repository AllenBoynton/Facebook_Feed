# Facebook_Feed
Mock Facebook feed

This app recreates the look and feel of the iOS Facebook feed, Friend Requests, and image animation. 
This app is my first attempt at creating the UI programmatically. There is no use of storyboards. 
Use of core animation shows feed image move to center screen and darken the background.
Used best practices with MVC design.
